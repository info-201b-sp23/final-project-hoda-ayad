# Introduction
For this final project, our group intends to determine whether the actors shown in Netflix movies/shows serve as a reliable indicator of the show/movie’s ratings. We want to see whether there is a direct relationship between the actors used in the shows/movies, and the ratings that the movies/shows receive after its initial release. It is important that we answer this question because of the value our project results can hold for streaming companies and film/show development firms in general, as there have been instances where the actors used did not make up for the low ratings the film/show received. Although it is important that good actors are used to make a good film, we want to see whether using famous actors boost the ratings the show/movie receives compared to using mediocre or lesser-known ones. In order to determine this, our group seeks to answer the following (but not limited to) possible research questions:

What role have actors played in the overall success of a movie? What is the relationship between the actors used in Netflix movies/shows and the third-party ratings the movies/show receives (e.g. Rotten Tomato, IMDb)? Has the choice in actors portrayed in Netflix shows/movies impacted the ratings its viewers give it?
